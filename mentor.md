I would like to express my deepest appreciation to **Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro**. Without his kind supports, my research life in Japan would not be possible.

And I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Professor Carlos Toshinori Ishi**, **Associate Professor Yuichiro Yoshikawa**, **Dr.Takashi Minato**, and **Dr. Chaoran Liu** for leading me into the world of robotics, speech technology, and artificial intelligence.
